# Bot-Template
This repository is a simple Pycord structure to create Discord bots without having to set up the initial stages. All the basic commands required for troubleshooting and structure, as well as some preparations for databases and cogs are included. The structure is easy to understand and compatible with new cogs on-the-go.
